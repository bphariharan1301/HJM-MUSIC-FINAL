## INSTALLATIONS GUIDE

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cd` to the project. 
3. Run this command `npm install` in your root directory to install all dependencies of the project for android.
4. Now, run 
  
      Windows/Android: 
      
      `npx react-native run-android`
      
      Mac/iOS:
     
     `npx react-native run-ios`
     
 And now you are good to go! 

PS: I will be adding more songs to it when I got the approval from a cloud storage service.

Enjoy your music time!
